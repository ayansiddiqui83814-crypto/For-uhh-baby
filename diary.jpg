<h1>🎁 Gift No.2 – Your Diary 📖</h1>

<img src="diary.jpg">

<p>
Iqra,  

You love writing in your diary.  
Every single day, you sit quietly and write your thoughts, your feelings, 
your little secrets, and sometimes… about us.  

You have a personal diary where our memories live.  
Our school talks, our silly fights, our lunch moments,  
the way we held hands and shared smiles.  

That diary is not just pages and ink.  
It is a place where your heart speaks freely.  
It is where our story is written in your handwriting.  

So I gifted you this diary because  
I want our memories to always have a safe place.  

One day when we look back,  
we will read those pages and smile,  
remembering how two people started their journey with pure love.  

Keep writing our story.  
And I promise, I will always give you beautiful moments to write about.
